Thanks to this wonderful [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB).

## Useful Commands
- jeky new web_name: creates a template website named web_name
- bundle exec jekyll serve: compile and serve
	- later, only *jekyll serve* will suffice 

## Important folders and files 
- \_posts: the folder stores all the blog posts
- \_site: all the files on the website, THe content alone in this folder will create the finished website (never modify, when modify other files, it will automatically be updated here for you)
- \_config.yml: the settings for the website, stored as key-value pairs
- Gemfile: stores the ruby dependencies of the website (plugin...)

## Front matter
info about the pages stored in the website
- eg. title, date, author...
- delinated by the --\- --- block in the header
- written in YAML, JSON

#### Default front matter
- values of front matter variables that can be applied to all the pages by default or part of the pages, defined in *\_config.yml* (both the files that are going to be applied and the default key-value pairs).
- when modified the *\_config.yml* file, restart the serve to see the changes
- example:

```
defaults:
  - 
    scope:
      path: "" #files that we want to apply the default front matter values to
      type: "posts" # type of the file we want to apply to 
    values:
        layout: "post" # set the default value of the front matter variable "layout"

```

## Blog posts 
- store in \_posts 
- format of the filename: yy-mm-dd-t-i-t-l-e, since some front matter variables are derived from the filename (eg, date, title). But we can always overwrite those variables in the actual front matter section of the post.
	- Note: the URL of the page is determined by the front matter variable in this default *posts* layout
- posts are written in html or markdown
- include front matter 

## Drafts
- store in \_drafts
- uses *serve --draft* to show up the drafts.
- a default date is given so do not have to name the filename with specific date

## Pages
- two types: blog posts and general pages like the about page
- a normal markdown with some front matter (just as posts)
- do not have title and date by default
- url is determined by the location of the page

## Permalinks
- url is determined by the value of the front matter variables
- what if you update the value of the front matter variables (eg. update the dates, change the categories), the original url will break
- use the *permalink* variable to set a permnant url to the page. 
- permalink can be a hard-coded URL, and it can also be a variable-URL that uses the value of front matter variables to construct the URL.
	- eg: /:year, /:categories, /:month, /:day, /:title
- create permalink for all the posts

## Themes
- by default, theme *minima* is used in the *\_config.yml*
- search *jekyll-theme* in [RubyGems.org](https://rubygems.org/) to preview the theme you like 
- then add the line *gem "theme_name"* to the *Gemfile*
- run *bundle install* to install all the dependencies listed in the *Gemfile* that you do not have 
- change the *theme* in *\_config.yml*
- finally, run *bundle exec jekyll serve*
- Note: the new theme may not have the layouts the *minima* has. 

## Layouts
- skeleton of html code to define the looks of the different types of pages on the site.
- by default, it comes with two layouts: page and post.
- customize layouts by first creating a *\_layouts* folder, and inside it, creates html files to overwrite/create certain layouts.

## [Variables](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/variables/)
- that can be accessed in the layouts files 
	- {{ content }}
	- {{ layout.xxx }} (xxx is a variable defined in the front matter of that layout file)
	- {{ page.yyy }} (yyy is a variable defined in the front matter of the page that applied this layout)
	- {{ site.zzz }} (zzz is a site-level variable defined in *\_config.yml*)

## Includes
Abstracts out a specific section of the sites
- eg: a dedicated header html files 
- create the *\_includes* folder 
- create *header,html* file
- include the *include header,html* into the layout file
- can pass arguments to the include files when "include" it. Like:
	*include header,html color="blue"*, and inside the headerhtml, it can use this color variable by referring *include.color*

## Data files 
- create *\_data* folder 
- format: csv, json, yml
- in the layout file, uses *site.data.dataFile* to access the data in the dataFile
- we can also loop through the data

## Static files 
- any file are not rendered by Jekyll (not having front matter)
	- js, css, images, pdf
- accessing those files using site.static_files (which include all the static files, no matter which directory they are in)
	- those files have variables like *.path*, *.name*, *basename*, *extname*
- we can give front matters to those files by modifying the *\_config.yml* [file](https://youtu.be/knWjmVlVpso?list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB&t=275)
