## Introduction
- This is a project with a team of four including me for the Cal Hack 5.0. Kayla is the abbreviation of Keyed-voice Analysis Yielding Language Assistance

## Abstraction
- Our objective was to provide a smooth and intuitive interface for facilitating communications between hearing-impaired people. By providing a text-to-speech application that understands multiple parties speaking and can learn to transcribe them separately, we can eliminate barrier for communications with sign language, and let communication flow naturally between everyone. Our dream for this application is eventually to have publish this to the world with support for up to 4 speakers across all platforms, with iOS and Android app support, with instant transcription to create seamless communication.
